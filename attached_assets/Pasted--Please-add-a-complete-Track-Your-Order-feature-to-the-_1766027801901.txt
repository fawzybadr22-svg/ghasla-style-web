
Please add a complete “Track Your Order” feature to the Ghasla Style app, with both a home page section and a dedicated page connected to the customer account and existing orders in Firestore/DB.

1) Home page section – Track Your Order

On the home page, under the hero/booking area, add a new section titled “Track Your Order” with Arabic subtitle, e.g.:

Title: “Track Your Order”

Subtitle: «تتبع حالة طلب غسلتك خطوة بخطوة برقم الطلب أو من حسابك مباشرة»

The section should contain:

An input field where the user can paste or type their Order ID.

A button labeled “Track Now” that, when clicked, queries the backend for that order.

If a valid order is found, show a compact status view directly in the home section:

Order status (pending / assigned / in_progress / completed / cancelled).

Service name (e.g. Exterior Wash), car type, and scheduled time.

A small progress indicator (e.g. stepper or horizontal bar) showing the current step.

If the user is logged in, also show a shortcut link “View all my orders” that opens the full tracking page in their account.

Handle invalid IDs gracefully with a clear message: “Order not found – please check your ID or log in to your account.”

2) Dedicated “Track Your Order” page for logged‑in customers

Create a new protected route/page, for example at /track-order or under the customer account (e.g. /account/track), only accessible to authenticated customers.

On this page, show:

A list of the customer’s recent orders (from Firestore/DB), with key info: Order ID, date/time, service, price, and current status.

When the customer clicks an order, open a detailed view with:

Timeline or stepper:

Order Created

Assigned to Driver

In Progress

Completed / Cancelled

Any scheduled arrival window, area, and car details.

If driver assignment and live updates exist in the backend, show live status by listening to real‑time changes in the order document.

Add a filter or dropdown to view orders by status (All, Active, Completed, Cancelled).

3) Data and integration details

Use the existing orders collection / model you already created. The Track feature should not create new data, only read existing orders by:

orderId (for guest/home tracking input).

customerId (for the logged‑in account page).

Ensure that Security Rules / backend checks enforce that:

A customer can only see their own orders when logged in.

The public home page “Track by Order ID” endpoint does NOT leak any sensitive personal info (e.g. hide customer name/phone; show only non‑sensitive summary).

If necessary, add a dedicated lightweight endpoint or Firestore query to fetch an order by its public order_code that you can share with the customer by WhatsApp or SMS.

4) UI/UX and animations

Keep the new section and page consistent with the Ghasla Style theme (dark background, orange/blue accents, RTL Arabic labels + English titles).

Add subtle animations: fade/slide in for the Track section on the home page, and for order cards on the tracking page.

Ensure the layout is fully responsive on mobile and desktop, with large tap targets for order cards on phones
