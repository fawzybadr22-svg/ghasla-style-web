Please design and implement a full “Before & After” section on the Ghasla Style home page that visually showcases all core services (external wash, interior cleaning, and full detailing) in three separate comparisons:\n> \n> 1) External Wash – Before & After \n> - Create a wide 16:9 comparison card for an everyday sedan in the same parking spot or driveway. \n> - On the left side (“Before”): the car body is clearly dirty with dust, mud splashes, rain spots, and dull windows and wheels. \n> - On the right side (“After”): the same car is fully clean with a deep, glossy shine, crystal‑clear glass, and bright, cleaned wheels, with soft reflections to emphasize the shine. \n> - Add a simple vertical slider or hover effect so the user can drag or reveal the transition between Before and After. \n> \n> 2) Interior Cleaning – Before & After \n> - Create a second comparison card showing the interior of an SUV (dashboard, center console, and front seats). \n> - Left (“Before”): visible dust on the dashboard, light stains on seats, clutter/cups in the cupholder, and generally dull materials. \n> - Right (“After”): all surfaces perfectly cleaned, materials looking refreshed (leather/fabric), everything organized, with a subtle highlight/gleam on the plastics and leather. \n> - Again, use a clear Before/After label and a smooth reveal animation (e.g. fade/slide) when the card enters the viewport. \n> \n> 3) Full Detailing & Polishing – Before & After \n> - Create a third comparison card for a premium car (sports car or luxury sedan) that focuses on paint correction and detailing. \n> - Left (“Before”): the paint looks slightly oxidized with visible swirl marks, light scratches, and dull tires. \n> - Right (“After”): the same angle and framing, but with extremely deep, glossy paint, strong reflections, almost no visible swirls, and freshly dressed, glossy tires. \n> - Emphasize the “mirror finish” effect to clearly communicate the value of full detailing. \n> \n> Branding & consistency \n> - All three comparisons should share a consistent layout, typography, and color scheme based on the Ghasla Style brand (dark background, dark orange accents, and blue highlights). \n> - Use small corner labels or tags for each card, such as “External Wash”, “Interior Deep Clean”, and “Full Detailing”, with Arabic subtitles under or next to them. \n> - If any staff or uniforms appear in the shots, keep the same uniform colors and logo as in the fleet section (dark orange + blue t‑shirts with the Ghasla Style logo), but do not focus on faces. \n> \n> Interactions & copy \n> - Place this section below the main services section. \n> - Add a short headline and subheading above the three cards, for example: \n> - Headline: “See the Difference – Before & After” \n> - Subheading (bilingual): a short Arabic + English line explaining that these transformations represent the real results of Ghasla Style’s services. \n> - Under the three cards, add a CTA button “Book Your Transformation Now” that scrolls back to the booking form at the top of the page.
