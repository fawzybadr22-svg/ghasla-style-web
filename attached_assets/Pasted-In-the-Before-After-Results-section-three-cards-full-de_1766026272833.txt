In the “Before & After Results” section (three cards: full detailing, interior cleaning, external wash), please upgrade the visuals and copy as follows:

Replace all current photos with more premium, realistic images

Use high‑quality, photorealistic car images that clearly show strong Before/After contrast for each service:

Card 1: full detailing / paint correction (sports or luxury car).

Card 2: deep interior cleaning (SUV interior).

Card 3: external wash for a daily sedan covered in dirt vs. completely clean.

Keep the same layout of three horizontal cards, but ensure all new photos are license‑free and stylistically consistent with the dark Ghasla Style theme (dark backgrounds, glossy look).

Use English “Before / After” labels only, embedded on the images

Remove any Arabic labels for this section and instead:

Place a small, stylish badge saying “Before” on the left side of each comparison image.

Place a matching badge saying “After” on the right side of each comparison image.

The badges should be visually integrated into the image (e.g. top‑left and top‑right corners of the photo) and always visible, not floating outside the card.

Use brand colors:

Before badge: subtle gray or green.

After badge: dark orange to highlight the result.

Add a short persuasive line under each card

Under each Before/After card, keep the service title (e.g. “Full Detailing”, “Interior Deep Clean”, “Exterior Wash”) and add a one‑line call‑to‑action that motivates the customer to book, in English only. Examples:

Full Detailing: “Turn dull paint into a mirror‑finish showroom shine.”

Interior Deep Clean: “Breathe in a fresh, spotless cabin – every trip.”

Exterior Wash: “Remove weeks of dirt in just one premium wash.”

Style the text to match the site typography and keep it centered under each card.

Add smooth animations to images and texts

When the section scrolls into view:

Each card should fade in and slide up slightly with a staggered delay (card 1, then 2, then 3).

The Before/After images can have a gentle zoom‑in on hover to draw attention.

Optionally add a subtle motion to the divider/transition between Before and After (e.g. glow effect when hovering the card).

Headline and subtext of the section should also fade/slide in together.

Add a WhatsApp “Order Service” button for each card

Under the descriptive line of each service card, add a WhatsApp CTA button with the official green color (#25D366) and text like “Order on WhatsApp”.

All buttons should link to the same WhatsApp number: https://wa.me/96596068518 with a prefilled message referencing the service, e.g.:

For Full Detailing: “Hi, I’d like to book a Full Detailing service.”

For Interior Deep Clean: “Hi, I’d like to book an Interior Deep Clean.”

For Exterior Wash: “Hi, I’d like to book an Exterior Wash.”

Add hover animation (color shift + slight scale) to these WhatsApp buttons to make them feel interactive.

General requirements

Keep the section fully responsive, with cards stacking nicely on mobile.

Maintain RTL support for surrounding Arabic UI while keeping this section’s labels and CTA lines in English as specified.

Ensure no console errors or layout breaks are introduced after these changes.
