Please apply the following fixes and enhancements to the Ghasla Style web app, point by point, and ensure everything is fully functional and polished.

1) Fix “Before / After” labels and add animation (image tnzyl‑38)

In the “Before & After” comparison section, correct the placement and language of all labels:

On every left side, clearly show a small badge or label reading “Before / قبل”.

On every right side, clearly show a small badge or label reading “After / بعد”.

Make sure there are no mixed labels (no “قبل” appearing on the After side, and no “بعد” on the Before side).

Align the labels consistently (e.g. top‑left for Before, top‑right for After), and keep them in brand colors (dark orange for After, green for Before).

Add a smooth, modern animation to the comparison:

Either use a draggable vertical slider allowing the user to slide between Before and After, or use a hover/reveal effect that fades between them.

Animate the labels to gently fade/slide in when the section enters the viewport.

Ensure the section remains fully responsive on mobile and desktop.

2) Fix and fully implement the registration system (image q7)

The current registration form does not accept Google, email, or phone sign‑ups. Implement a complete, working auth system using Firebase Authentication or the existing backend, with these flows:

Google Sign‑In (OAuth):

Add a working “Sign in with Google” button at the top of the form.

On click, trigger the Firebase Google provider flow.

On success, create/update a user document in the database with name, email, avatar (if available), and default role customer.

Email + Password registration:

Validate that the email is in a correct format and not already used.

Enforce a minimum password strength (length + at least one number or symbol).

On success, create the user in Firebase Auth and a matching profile document.

Phone number registration/login (optional second factor):

Implement phone auth with SMS OTP.

Provide an input field for phone number with Kuwait code by default (+965) and basic validation.

After verifying OTP, link the phone number to the user account.

On the UI side:

Keep the Arabic labels exactly as shown in q7 (الاسم الكامل، البريد الإلكتروني، رقم الهاتف، كلمة المرور…).

Show clear error messages when any field is invalid or when auth fails (e.g. “هذا البريد مستخدم بالفعل” / “This email is already in use”).

After successful registration, redirect the user to their account/dashboard and show a success toast.

Make sure all three methods (Google, email, phone) are tested and working end‑to‑end.

3) Improve area selection, address, and date/time picking (image q8)

Replace the current grid of area buttons (Ahmadi, Farwaniya, Fahaheel, …) with a vertical scrollable list or dropdown:

Use a clean scrollable dropdown or list where the user can scroll down to choose the area instead of a large grid.

Keep all existing area names (in English/Arabic) but present them in a more compact, mobile‑friendly UI.

For the address field:

Add a clickable icon or button inside the address input (e.g. a location pin).

When the user clicks it, attempt to auto‑detect the location using the browser’s Geolocation API and/or Google Maps Autocomplete:

If permission is granted, fill the address field with the detected location text (street, area).

Show a small note like “تم تحديد موقعك تلقائياً” when successful.

For date and time:

Replace manual text inputs with proper date picker and time picker components.

Date picker: calendar UI where the user taps to select the day.

Time picker: dropdown or clock UI to select hour and minutes in 24‑hour format.

Prevent selecting past dates/times; only allow current/future slots.

Ensure these controls work well on mobile (touch‑friendly) and desktop.

4) Enhance feature icons section with car backgrounds (image q6)

In the section that currently shows simple orange icons (crown, sparkle, car, etc.), add background images of modern, clean cars behind each icon to make the section more premium:

Use high‑resolution photos of recent, clean cars that fit the brand (sedan/SUV), but do not copy the exact reference images.

Apply a dark overlay (gradient or semi‑transparent black) over the photos so that the orange icons remain clearly visible.

Keep the icons centered, with the overlay ensuring good contrast.

Add subtle animations:

On hover, slightly brighten the background photo and scale the icon up by a few percent.

On scroll into view, fade/slide the cards in from below.

Make sure the backgrounds match the overall color palette (dark blue + orange) and do not visually clash with the rest of the page.

5) Quality and consistency requirements

For all changes above, maintain RTL support for Arabic and keep all new text bilingual where appropriate (Arabic primary, English secondary).

Ensure no console errors are thrown in the browser after these updates.

Keep styles consistent with the existing design system (fonts, colors, border radius, shadows) already used in the Ghasla Style project.

Test on desktop and mobile viewport sizes to confirm everything looks good and is fully usable.
